This Project is just some ideas that I am working on, experimentation, quick automation, etc. One day I will clean all this mess and make it a real project. But for now, it is just a bunch of scripts that I am using to learn and experiment. Related to ERC20 manipulation, buy / sell, watch dev wallet and more. EVM manipulation, call functions, bytecode manipulation, etc.

-> A sophisticated Golang-based blockchain automation tool that replicates and broadcasts smart contract transactions across multiple wallets on EVM-compatible networks. This project demonstrates advanced blockchain development skills including transaction decoding, ABI manipulation, HD wallet management, and multi-chain support.

ClaimAndSell
Special bot for Tomb fork

This bot allows to automate the claim and the sell in a Tomb fork
TokenX-ETH-LP
Deposit TokenX-ETH-LP Earn TokenXShare

This automation allows to deposit a lp of type tokenX-ETH in the liquidity pool of a fork falls and claim every x time. The claim will give in reward a tokenXShare and then proceeds to sell the amount of tokenXShare against the ETH token

Here the ETH coin represents the coint of the chain on which the fork Tomb is (FTM,AVAX...)

LoopStreamAndSell
This repo is a v1 made in December 2021

There is a need to change the architecture of the code and how it works. Need to switch to TS and switch from ether.js library to web3.js


Bot that allows to follow in real time the actions of an address: ours and to trigger a swap token event. Then there is determination of the dev wallet of the token thus bought and a stream of these actions. If the dev wallet performs a scam type action the bot will automatically sell the token we just swapped

getWalletBalance.js Allows to find the total amount that an address has of token X

ScrappingCreatorAddress.js Find the address that created the token X

sellYourToken.js Takes the amount that the user has of token X and the router on which he bought the token X and sells the totality for the token Y that he had put before

TriggerEventAdress.js Stream transactions made by an address A:
Two cases of use:

If A is the user: if A buys a token X on a router B (swap) it will automatically approve the expenditure of the token X on the router B.
If A is the address which created the token X it will look at its transactions and check if it does not carry out scammy transactions (approve the LP on the router B (rugpull), sell the token X (soft rug))

# ApeCoin Airdrop Tracker
A Node.js application to track and monitor unclaimed ApeCoin airdrops for Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) NFT collections.
